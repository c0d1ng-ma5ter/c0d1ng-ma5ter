## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @c0d1ng-ma5ter

I just felt like letting the default heading live

I'm your average camper on FCC, contributor to its codebase, and Roblox Studio developer. Also a math and music guy.

I'm found under the same name on FCC, its forums, and some other stuff (but with the hyphen replaced by an underscore). On Youtube and some other stuff I'm under the name "JebVal" (Yes, I play KSP!)
